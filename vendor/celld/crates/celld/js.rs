// Streaming decoders live in a per-isolate table keyed by id; JS frees
// one on the final decode (last=true), on a fatal error (encoding_rs
// poisons an errored decoder), or via FinalizationRegistry when a
// mid-stream decoder is abandoned. Ids are never reused, so a late
// finalizer free of an already-closed id is a no-op.

/// Live streaming decoders for one isolate, keyed by an id JS holds across
/// awaits.
///
/// An isolate slot rather than a process-wide `Mutex<HashMap<..>>` like
/// [`zlib_streams`]. The reason that one is process-wide holds here too — a
/// `TextDecoder` in streaming mode outlives the turn that made it, and the
/// next turn can run on a different tokio worker — but it argues against a
/// *thread-local*, not against this. A `TextDecoder` is a JS object, so it
/// never leaves the isolate that made it, and every op that touches its
/// decoder runs under that isolate's `v8::Locker`. The lock the embedder
/// already holds is what makes the access exclusive, which `&mut Isolate`
/// on the slot then proves. A second lock inside it buys nothing.
///
/// This removes a ceiling rather than a measured regression, and the
/// difference matters. In isolation the pattern does collapse: replayed on
/// its own — remove, decode outside the lock, insert — 256-byte chunks
/// peaked at two threads and then went *backwards*, 8 threads serving
/// 0.46x what 1 thread served against 6.7x for the same decoding with no
/// table. But celld end to end shows no difference between the two, at any
/// concurrency this hardware can drive, because a chunk costs about 42us
/// of stream and turn machinery around a lock held for about 100ns. So the
/// mutex was not what any cell was waiting on. It was a process-wide
