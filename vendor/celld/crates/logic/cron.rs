//! Cron trigger schedules, reified sans-IO.
//!
//! A `triggers.crons` entry in the Wrangler config becomes one reserved cell
//! whose alarm is armed at the next occurrence. Everything about *when* that
//! is — parsing the expression, walking to the next minute, choosing between
//! a retry and the next occurrence — is a pure function of the expression and
//! a timestamp. The cell and its alarm row are the executor.
//!
//! Resolution is one minute and the zone is UTC, matching both Cloudflare's
//! cron triggers and the minute buckets the wake index already uses
//! (`wake::entry_key`). The schedule is therefore never more precise than the
//! alarm that carries it.
//!
//! The dialect is Cloudflare's, read out of `saffron` (the parser behind Cron
//! Triggers) rather than out of a POSIX cron manual, because the two disagree
//! on the day-of-week numbers and silence is the worst way to find that out.
//! Cloudflare numbers the weekdays 1 to 7 from Sunday and rejects 0, so `1-5`
//! is Sunday to Thursday there and Monday to Friday in Vixie cron. Two places
//! where `saffron` contradicts its own comments are called out at the code that
//! declines to copy them.
